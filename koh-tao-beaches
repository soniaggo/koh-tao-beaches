🌴 React Project - Koh Tao Beaches

This is a personal project made with React where I show a ranking of beaches from the island of Koh Tao (Thailand).
The idea came up because I love traveling and wanted to practice React with something that really motivates me 💙.

🚀 What does the app do?

📋 Displays a list of beaches with their photos, description, and a voting system.

🔍 Includes a search bar to filter beaches by name.

⭐ You can vote for your favorite beaches, and the ranking updates automatically.

🖼️ Each beach has its own card with an image gallery and a more detailed description.

🛑 Service icons (showers, toilets, lifeguards) are shown, although in Koh Tao you usually won’t find them 😅, so they’re crossed out.

📝 Allows adding reviews/comments about each beach (saved in localStorage).

💾 Votes are also saved in localStorage, so they don’t disappear when reloading the page.

🛠️ Technologies used

React

SCSS

React Icons

Swiper.js
